The present package finds its roots in the need of using representative heating load curve for the simulation and optimization of various District Heating Network (DHN) production plant. The main principle is to disagreggate monthly or yearly heat load into an hourly heat load using an hourly based external temperature profile. The resulting load curve also includes DHN supply and return temperatures.

This package was used for the study of a production plant combining Power-to-Heat, Biomass and Storage ([Lamaison et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.044)). It was also the tool used to generate various heat load curves in a study of long term storage management ([Cuisinier et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.122773)).

More recently, it was used in a collaboration between RTE and CEA with the aim of representing DHN in the RTE tool Antares. The final objective was to study the additional flexibility offered by DHN to the electrical grid.
